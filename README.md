# WattsUp IoT system
for educational purposes - physics school projects

### Iterative design: Test -> Reflect -> Improve
WattsUp is an educational IoT system designed for hands-on physics lessons. Students manage small-scale power generators, experimenting with variables like blade angles or water drive types to optimize electrical output. The project bridges the gap between physical experiments and digital data monitoring.

Components:
- IoT node: Arduino UNO, INA3221/INA219 sensors
- Node-RED gateway
- MongoDB storage
- possible connection to cloud web app
